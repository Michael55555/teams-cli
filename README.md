# Microsoft Teams CLI
(Work in Progress)

## Motivation
Personally I use Microsoft Teams for education, but I found myself waiting a long time for the app to load, this is what should be fixed with this cli. Additionally we'd like to have a minimal interface which fits right into the developer environment. I hope that we'll be able to make this CLI somewhat helpful to the average developer and contain enough information to replace the UI.
